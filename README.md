Wordpress Base Theme
====================

This is the base skeleton for our bootstrap based theme. Some code is derived from the http://roots.io/sage project - namely the Theme Wrapper, the Asset management, and the gulp build file.

Requirements
============

This theme requires the Snap plugin.

For development, you will also need to ensure the following is installed:
 - nodejs
 - npmjs
 - bower

Installation
============

To get started, clone this repo into the `themes` directory of your Wordpress install. In the new theme directory, you need to run:

    npm install
    bower install

This should install everything you need to develop and build the theme.

Development and Building
========================

See https://github.com/roots/sage for more information.
